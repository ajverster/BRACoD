\title{Run the main BRACoD algorithm}
\usage{
run_bracod(df_relabl, env_var, n_sample = 1000, n_burn = 1000, njobs = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_var}{the environmnetal variable you are evaluating. You need 1 measurement associated with each sample.}

\item{n_sample}{number of posterior samples.}

\item{n_burn}{number of burn-in steps before actual sampling stops.}

\item{njobs}{number of parallel MCMC chains to run.}

\item{df}{A dataframe of relative microbiome abundances. Samples are rows and bacteria are columns.}
}
\description{
Uses pymc3 to sample the posterior of the model to determine bacteria that are
associated with your environmental variable.
