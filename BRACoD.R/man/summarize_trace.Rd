\usage{
summarize_trace(trace, bug_names = NULL, cutoff = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{trace}{the pymc3 object that is the output of run_bracod()}

\item{bug_names}{optional, a list of names of the bacteria to include in the results}

\item{cutoff}{this is the cutoff on the average inclusion for inclusion}
}
\description{
This summarizes the trace object that run_bracod() returns. It returns a dataframe
that contains two parameters of interest, the average inclusion (p) and the average
coefficient (beta), telling you the association between that bacteria and the environmental
